1) Algorithm development for interface between a microscope and laser system
2) Existing algorithm modification for cell segmentation and co-localization
analysis for automated cell classification during imaging
3) Integration of cell classification algorithm into microscope-laser system
4) Laser control based on cell classification
5) System evaluation through simple experiments
